## Aim of Repository

Essentially, this repository isn't of any interest to anyone. Most repositories on GitHub are there for project purposes. Mine, on the contrary, was made for learning purposes. And the files you'll find here on this repository aren't of any value either. Often it's worth spending some time exploring some of the repositories on GitHub such as the one I just found [jlevy/the-art-of-command-line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) [The mentioned repository is the most starred and watched one on the hub for command line], but it's not the case with mine ðŸ˜‰.

I appreciate your understanding!

## Why No License?!

Obviously, you couldn't find any `LICENSE.md` file, because it isn't an open source project. However, it's certainly certfieble as I make significant changes to it later on, i.e. the project may become open source, in case I add up to it. By then, I'll provide the apropriate documentation for the project.
